# pattern-benchmark
This is a notes page for my ideas on how to create a benchmark for human reasoning. 
The idea would be to write code that generates prompts that could be solved by a human or AI model.
If an AI could recognise patterns in this benchmark it would be capable of reasoning about things in the physical world.

## Concepts from data visualisation
I studied data visualisation in university and many of the concepts came down to fundamental ideas of using inherent skills that humans have in order to change an abstract set of data into something that the visual and pattern recognition processing parts of our brains understand. We could use these data visualisation ideas to create a static - then a dynamic - set of tests that ideally humans do well at but AI systems would need to be trained on in order to understand physical phenomena. This benchmark isn't about language processing but visual processing instead and hopefully at some point the vectors that represent the concepts (eg. symmetry) could also be turned into words where the visual system produces symbolic words for the understanding that it has.

## The core static types of pattern recognition
* translation
* rotation
* reflection
* scaling
* symmetry
